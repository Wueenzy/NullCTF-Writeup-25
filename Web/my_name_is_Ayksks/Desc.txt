I have recently come across a delightful thing. Developers. Such cute little creatures. I made a developer portal for them in order to be nice. But what did they do? Abuse my server! I assembled an army of admins to ban them all. They even said my name resembles something, how dare they mock the great Ayksks, king of developers!
