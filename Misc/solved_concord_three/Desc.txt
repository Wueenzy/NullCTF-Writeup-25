Not so tough this time! Evil Twin has been (hopefully!) defeated, but Good Twin still stands. A lot of people have been spamming "!flag" in the server, hoping to actually get one. Can you find out if the Good Twin lied to us or if it really does give out flags? PS: She hates spaces in display names.
